              <span>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                     language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to
                     the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                     JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                     language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                     extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                     Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                     Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                     elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                     navigation.
                     Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
                     JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate
                     with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the
                     application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</span>
